    "### Motivation:\n",
    "* What is your dataset?\n",
    "  * Socio-economic data for Copenhagen: [data.kk.dk](https://data.kk.dk/dataset/samlede-socio-data-kbh)\n",
    "  * The dataset contains measurements for different areas in Copenhagen from 2008 until 2014. Some areas are missing a lot of data.\n",
    "  * The dataset contains information about Educational level, Income level and how old people are in the area.\n",
    "* Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?\n",
    "  * Because we are interested in knowing how education and age influences the income level and where people live.\n",
    "  * By using this dataset we can explore different kinds of information about people. We have different age groups and educational levels. So we can find the areas with the most rich people living and the poorer neighborhoods. \n",
    "* What was your goal for the end user’s experience?\n",
    "  * The purpose of our visualization is to give the user an overview of where the poor and rich neighborhoods are and what educational level and how old people are in that area. Such that people moving to Copenhagen can find a neighborhood that suits them and where they fit in."

    "  * Only use columns regarding educational level, income and age. Our processed dataset can be found [here](processed_data.csv).\n",
    "* Write a short section that discusses the dataset stats, containing key points/plots from your exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "  * Total size of our data is 596.9 KB \n",
    "  * The number of rows are 2675 (including headers)\n",
    "  * The date range is 2008-2014\n",
    "  * The educational levels, income levels and age groups are in percent\n",
    "  * We have created an extra column containing the mean of the income level in a given area. Computed by $\\left(\\frac{1 \\times low + 2 \\times medium + 3 \\times high}{100}\\right)$ for each area, where low stands for the percent of people with low income in the area, medium for the percent of people with medium income and the same holds for high.\n",
    "  * We have created a Random Forest regression model to predict the average income level for 2014 since this was not included in the dataset.\n",
    "  * The predictions was based on the Age groups and Educational level."

    "* Why are they right for the story you want to tell?\n",
    "  * Because interactivity provides effective and significant information of data to exploring for users and it is simple to visualize.\n",
    "  * Also the map gives an easy way to interpert the location of the areas. The histogram gives a great overview of the people living in the area. And finally the donut chart is a fun and smart way to show how the educations are distributed among the people in the area.\n"
